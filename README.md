# Image-Uploader-in-React-Native
Image/ video uploader in React-Native using <a href="https://github.com/react-community/react-native-image-picker">ImagePicker</a> and fetch. 

If you use my example API, you may need to set the folder- and file permissions on the server to 777 for development purposes and enable php on the serverside (assuming you use apache).

If running on an iOS you may need to run the ImagePicker installation steps for iOS, because this repo is only tested on Android so far.

Feel free to leave feedback.
