# Image-Uploader-in-React-Native
Image/ video uploader in React-Native using <a href="https://github.com/react-community/react-native-image-picker">ImagePicker</a> and fetch(). Now supports creating a database entry for the uploaded file!

If you use my example API, you may need to set the folder- and file permissions on the server to 777 for development purposes and enable php on the serverside (assuming you use apache).

For the server side of scripts I included PHP examples in /API. 

If running on an iOS you may need to run the ImagePicker installation steps for iOS (check link above), because this repo is only tested on Android so far.

Please leave feedback!
